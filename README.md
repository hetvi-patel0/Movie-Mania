# Movie-Mania
This project is to create a console-based Movie Database Management System. 
It handles creating new entries in a proprietary databse as well as returning searches for the items in the current databse.
It uses a db.txt database file to save to and load in every entries.
There are two classes for reading and writing files. A class for keyboard input.
It searches by title, actors, year, runtime and director. You can also add anew entry into the existing text file.
